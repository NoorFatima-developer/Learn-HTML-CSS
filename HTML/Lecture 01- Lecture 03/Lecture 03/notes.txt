Episode 03:

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) and OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) are both networking models that define a set of protocols and standards to facilitate communication between devices on a network. 

TCP/IP Contain 4 Layers : 

Application layer, Transport layer, Internet layer, and Network Access layer. 
Each layer is responsible for specific functions, such as handling data transmission, addressing, error control, and flow control.

OSI Contain 7-layer model that was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 

The seven layers of the OSI model are :-
Application layer, Presentation layer, Session layer, Transport layer, Network layer, Data Link layer, and Physical layer. 

Each layer provides specific functions, such as managing the connection, encryption, compression, routing, and framing of data.

The major differences between TCP/IP and OSI models are:
- TCP/IP is a simpler model and more commonly used, whereas OSI is a more complex model and less commonly used.
- TCP/IP combines the presentation and session layers of OSI into the application layer.
- TCP/IP does not include the physical and data link layers as separate layers, instead combining them into the Network Access layer.
- TCP/IP is more flexible than OSI, allowing for more variation in implementations.
- TCP/IP is used for communication between different networks and is used in applications such as web browsing, email, and file sharing, while OSI is primarily used in academic and research environments.

In summary, both TCP/IP and OSI models provide a framework for standardizing communication protocols in computer networking. TCP/IP is a simpler and more widely used model used for Internet communication, while OSI is a more complex and less commonly used model used more in academic and research environments.


IPv4 has a 32-bit address length.	
IPv6 has a 128-bit address length.
Generally, IPv6 is faster than IPv4. However, when we go to a larger packet size, IPv6 can be slow in some cases.
need of ipv6 is to improve security and support for mobile devices ....
