Lecture 18 HOMEWORK:

Pixels per inch (PPI) refers to the number of pixels contained within each inch of a digital image.
DPI stands for Dots per Inch, referring to the number of ink droplets a printer will produce per inch while printing an image.
The more dots of ink per inch the picture has, the more detail you will see when printed.

A good picture should have higher ppi before printing and higher dpi after printing.

2) Logical pixel :- Aslo know as device independent pixel. These provide consistent layout and sizing for different device . By defining UI elements, font sizes, and image dimensions in logical pixels, developers can achieve a consistent appearance across various screen sizes and resolutions. The logical pixel values are then translated into the appropriate number of physical pixels based on the device's pixel density.

Physical pixel :- They are the individual dots or points of light that make up the screen's resolution. These dots together help us in seeing the vedio , images etc.
